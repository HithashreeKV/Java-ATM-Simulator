# ATM Simulator (Java)

ATM Simulator (Java Swing GUI)

This is a simple ATM Simulator built using Java and Swing.
The project allows a user to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and view transaction history — all inside a clean graphical user interface.

I built this project to practice Java OOP concepts and GUI development. It also helped me revise event handling, class design, and basic user input validation.

## Features

- Create an account with:
  - Account ID
  - Owner name
  - Initial balance

- Perform ATM operations:
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money
  - View updated balance
  - See complete transaction history

- User-friendly GUI using Java Swing  
- Separate classes for Account, Transaction, and GUI (proper OOP structure)
